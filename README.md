## Installation

To install Papertrail Route, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `papertrailroute` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/madebykind/craft-papertrail-route/papertrailroute.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require https://github.com/madebykind/craft-papertrail-route/papertrailroute`
